      <description>Ah, lunch.
The finest meal of the day.
What would we do without it?
Fitting snuggly in the middle of the long gap between breakfast and dinner, ensuring one isn&amp;rsquo;t famished.
Lunch, the meal that we enjoy basking in the brightest light of the day, the Sun blessing the Earth.
Lunch is the meal that brings people together, where guests visit for lunch before leaving to return home for dinner.</description>

      <title>Life in Quarantine</title>

      <description>What a bore, life has become, during these times of quarantine;
Whiling away the time, sitting at a desk, not a soul in site;
Although it is rather fortunate, for the few of us that prefer it;
Although most&amp;rsquo;d rather not be stuck at home, the alternative is most unpreferable, even to those who yearn to roam;
For the virus is spreading and killing at large, without a care for whom it smites, it strikes with no prejudice;</description>
