      <description>Introduction A little over a month ago, I decided to participate in an upcoming hackathon. For those not in the know, a hackathon, sometimes also called a codefest, is an event where people work in teams to rapidly develop a product within a set time limit. They can come in the form of a competition where the goal is for one team to win, or, when hosted by a company, to complete the implementation of a feature in their product.</description>

      <description>Introduction When you spend a lot of your time working on a command line interface, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty important (at least for me) to make sure that you like how your command line looks and that it is an efficient environment that can boost your productivity in your command line workflow.
A customised terminal is unique and brings the personality of the user into the console, highlighting what the user thinks is important, as well as bringing in a little style to stand out from the boring black and white terminals with a single dollar sign line indicator.</description>

      <description>Ah, lunch.
The finest meal of the day.
What would we do without it?
Fitting snuggly in the middle of the long gap between breakfast and dinner, ensuring one isn&amp;rsquo;t famished.
Lunch, the meal that we enjoy basking in the brightest light of the day, the Sun blessing the Earth.
Lunch is the meal that brings people together, where guests visit for lunch before leaving to return home for dinner.</description>

      <title>Life in Quarantine</title>

      <description>What a bore, life has become, during these times of quarantine;
Whiling away the time, sitting at a desk, not a soul in site;
Although it is rather fortunate, for the few of us that prefer it;
Although most&amp;rsquo;d rather not be stuck at home, the alternative is most unpreferable, even to those who yearn to roam;
For the virus is spreading and killing at large, without a care for whom it smites, it strikes with no prejudice;</description>

      <description>This article, which was inscribed on what is known to be a scripture from the beginning of the Gregorian Calendar Time, offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme. It also serves the purpose of showing off how advanced and beautiful my website is.
