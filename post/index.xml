      <description>Disclaimer: If you plan on using this article as a guide for setting up your OWN raspberry pi nas (which I hope you do üòÅ), PLEASE read the entire article before going through with this process (It will help clear any doubts you have as well as ensure that you can go through with this process). Also, do remember that I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE for any damage that YOU may cause to yourself or your own hardware including, but not limited to: bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed.</description>

      <description>Ah, lunch.
The finest meal of the day.
What would we do without it?
Fitting snuggly in the middle of the long gap between breakfast and dinner, ensuring one isn&amp;rsquo;t famished.
Lunch, the meal that we enjoy basking in the brightest light of the day, the Sun blessing the Earth.
Lunch is the meal that brings people together, where guests visit for lunch before leaving to return home for dinner.</description>

      <description>What a bore, life has become, during these times of quarantine;
Whiling away the time, sitting at a desk, not a soul in site;
Although it is rather fortunate, for the few of us that prefer it;
Although most&amp;rsquo;d rather not be stuck at home, the alternative is most unpreferable, even to those who yearn to roam;
For the virus is spreading and killing at large, without a care for whom it smites, it strikes with no prejudice;</description>
