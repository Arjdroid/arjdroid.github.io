      <description>What a bore, life has become, during these times of quarantine;
Whiling away the time, sitting at a desk, not a soul in site;
Although it is rather fortunate, for the few of us that prefer it;
Although most&amp;rsquo;d rather not be stuck at home, the alternative is most unpreferable, even to those who yearn to roam;
For the virus is spreading and killing at large, without a care for whom it smites, it strikes with no prejudice;</description>
